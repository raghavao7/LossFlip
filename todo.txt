From here, nice future upgrades we can bolt on (again, safely):

Add a “Payments” history tab (just reading current orders).

Add status badges in Chats (“Awaiting Payment”, “Paid & Held”, “Released”, “In Dispute”).

Start wiring basic auth (JWT) instead of x-user header.

Whenever you’re ready, tell me what you want to plug in next and I’ll keep it as clean as this change.
